2. To log in, type `ssh cs15lwi23***@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the terminal window, replacing the username with your own.
3. Enter your password *at least* **twenty-seven times**. This is a safety feature that was implemented to prevent people from having fun.

## Inputting random commands and trying not to crash your computer

Once you're logged in, you have access to the your CSE 15L files. I put in a bunch of letters. Luckily, my laptop is still currently within safe operating temperatures.

Here are some commands you can use to navigate the file system:

* cd {directory name} (changes the working directory)
* ls (lists contents on the current directory)
* pwd (outputs the path of the working directory to the console)
* mkdir {folder name} (creates a folder)
